# Twitter_Elastic-Search_Project
This includes the source code and other files including all the dependencies for creating a Kafka producer to fetch tweets in real time and put them into a Kafka topic. Later, I'll be including the same for the Kafka Consumer which will fetch the data from Kafka topic and put it into Elastic Search.
