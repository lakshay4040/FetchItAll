# Twitter_Elastic-Search_Project
This includes the source code and other files including all the dependencies for creating a Kafka producer to fetch tweets in real time and put them into a Kafka topic. Later, I'll be including the same for the Kafka Consumer which will fetch the data from Kafka topic and put it into Elastic Search.

This code has been written in Eclipse 2020-06 version as a Maven Project.
Dependencies for Kafka, slf4j-simple, and Twitter (hbc-core) were taken from mvnrepository.com
To run this code, make sure your system has Kafka (v1.1.0 or higher).
